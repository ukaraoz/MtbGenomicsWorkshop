The dataset we will be using for today's and tomorrow's practicals is a subset of 1000 *M. tuberculosis* isolates from a Russian population. The results of this study was published by Casali et al.: `Evolution and transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis in a Russian population <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939361/>`_. These isolates have been whole-genome shotgun sequenced using Illumina platform (2x100 bp). Raw read data has been deposited to European Nucleotide Archive under Study Accession `PRJEB2138 <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB2138>`_. For this tutorial, we will focus on a subset of these isolates (n=99 isolates).
